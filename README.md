# A_Star_Algorithm


Hello there! 

This program is designed to run a pathfinding algorithm and comes with three pre-built mazes for you to choose from - small, medium, and large. If you'd like to use a different maze, simply navigate to the 'SETUP' and 'SOLVE' sections of the code and modify the parameters to your desired specifications. 

You can even create your own maze by adding a new list that represents a matrix. Within this new maze, a '0' represents a walkable area, while a '3' represents an obstacle.

To get started, you can set your starting and ending coordinates in the 'set_start' and 'set_end' functions. Once you've made your adjustments, simply run the program. As the algorithm progresses, green nodes will be added to the open list, while red nodes will be moved to the closed list. Ultimately, the blue nodes will represent the path created by the algorithm. 

Have fun exploring the possibilities of this program!
