# A_Star_Algorithm

Hello there!

This program is designed to run a pathfinding algorithm and comes with three pre-built mazes for you to choose from - small, medium, and large. You can also create your own maze by adding a new list with your desired number of rows and columns. Within this new maze, a '0' represents a walkable area, while a '3' represents an obstacle.

To get started, you'll need to set your starting and ending coordinates and select the maze you want to use. Once you've made your adjustments, simply run the program. As the algorithm progresses, green nodes will be added to the open list, while red nodes will be moved to the closed list. Ultimately, the blue nodes will represent the path created by the algorithm.

It's important to use the "A*-algorithm_Heap.py" file for solving, as this version is the most efficient due to its use of a heap data structure. The original "A*-algorithm.py" file is a bit less efficient as it uses quicksort. The "Min_Heap.py" file is the heap data structure that the main program uses, and you can use this code in other projects, but I recommend checking out Python's built-in "heapq" module as it's way better! ;-)

If you have any ideas on how to optimize the heap further, please let me know in the comments of the YouTube video linked below.

Have fun exploring the possibilities of this program!
